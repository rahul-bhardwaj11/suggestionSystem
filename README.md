A Simple web app that shows a input field on pressing ctrl+a+space and shows Suggestions based on input.

To run the app locally:

git clone

npm install

npm start
 
open http://localhost:3000/

Concept : when someone type in input field then the data is fetched only when there is some delay between  key pressing events.
